# Add an evidence-based field observation assistant

## Summary

Replace the shallow binary identification key with a transparent observation
assistant. The tool must help a beginner collect evidence, narrow the ten WMO
genera, understand ambiguity, and decide what to observe next.

## Context

The encyclopedia is extensive, but its main identification key asks only a few
binary questions and returns broad groups without explaining how evidence was
weighted. WMO guidance emphasizes cloud dimensions, shape, structure, texture,
luminance, continuous evolution, and observing the whole sky.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a structured field-observation model and transparent scoring engine.
2. Build a five-step mobile-first observation flow.
3. Return three ranked hypotheses with supporting and conflicting evidence.
4. Recommend the next discriminating observation when results are close.
5. Add a side-by-side comparison of the two leading hypotheses.
6. Connect the assistant to the home page, atlas, monographs, and journal.
7. Add authoritative source coverage and automated methodology tests.
8. Verify mobile and desktop layouts and publish the Pages release.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The assistant records shape, element scale, light, precipitation, and
      change over time.
- [x] Every answer can be revised before or after results.
- [x] Results show three hypotheses instead of claiming certainty.
- [x] Every hypothesis explains matching and conflicting evidence.
- [x] Close results produce a useful next observation.
- [x] The two strongest hypotheses can be compared side by side.
- [x] The method is explicitly educational and cites WMO observation guidance.
- [ ] The tool works comfortably at 390 px and with keyboard navigation.
- [x] The former binary key is removed rather than left as a competing method.
- [x] Automated tests cover scoring, ambiguity, and deterministic ordering.
- [x] Tests, production build, link audit, and Pages deployment pass.
- [x] Users can compare two or three genera across the same seven evidence and
      interpretation dimensions.
- [x] Every genus appears in a recommended disputed pair with a dedicated
      discriminating observation.
- [x] Monographs, field results, and hard cases link directly into comparison.

## Design Decisions

### From Plan

1. **Evidence before labels:** The tool asks about visible properties and
   temporal change before displaying cloud names.
2. **No automatic recognition:** The user remains the observer; no camera,
   upload, or model inference is introduced.
3. **Progressive disclosure:** The first pass stays approachable, while result
   explanations expose expert reasoning and uncertainty.

### Emerged

1. **Three hypotheses are journal evidence:** A result can be transferred to
   the private journal with the selected features, confidence tier, and three
   leading genera. The user still supplies place and can revise the draft.
2. **Pair-specific discriminators:** Commonly confused pairs have dedicated
   next-observation guidance; other pairs fall back to a whole-sky,
   time-series check.
3. **Release cache boundary:** The service worker cache is bumped to v2 so the
   former binary key does not remain in returning users' offline shell.
4. **Relative install metadata:** Manifest and Apple touch icon links remain
   relative in the HTML so both Vite development and GitHub Pages resolve the
   repository base exactly once.
5. **Comparison without duplicate science:** The comparison laboratory reads
   existing genus profiles through seven shared dimensions instead of creating
   a second, diverging encyclopedia.
6. **Two-to-three hypothesis limit:** Two columns support direct differential
   diagnosis; a third supports uncertain field cases without turning the tool
   into an unreadable ten-column matrix.

## Implementation Notes

- Added five structured evidence questions and a deterministic weighted scoring
  engine with positive and negative signals for all ten WMO genera.
- Results expose the top three genera, supporting and conflicting evidence,
  uncertainty tier, next discriminating observation, and a visual comparison
  of the leading pair.
- Integrated the observer with the home feature strip, atlas tabs, cloud
  monographs, and private journal draft flow.
- Added the WMO `Identifying clouds` methodology source and included it in the
  automated external-link monitor.
- Added content, foundation, scoring, ambiguity, deterministic-ordering, and
  journal-draft tests.
- Published commit `c478cd1` through GitHub Pages and verified the public HTML,
  JavaScript bundle, CSS bundle, manifest, and service worker cache v2.
- Added a full differential comparison laboratory covering all ten genera,
  eight disputed-pair presets, and seven shared dimensions: appearance,
  composition, formation, evolution, weather, aviation, and diagnostic trap.
- Expanded hard cases from three to eight and connected them, monographs, and
  observer results to the comparison laboratory.
- Published commit `9c8ff81`; the GitHub Actions build and Pages deployment
  completed successfully.
- Verified the public JavaScript and CSS bundles, direct comparison route, and
  service worker cache `cloud-recognition-v3`.

## Issues Encountered

- The Codex in-app browser had no available browser surface, so screenshot-based
  visual QA is still pending rather than being inferred from a successful
  build.
- A local HTML check exposed doubled repository prefixes for install metadata.
  Relative manifest and touch-icon paths now resolve correctly in development
  and production builds.
- Comparison tests exposed a reversed `cirrus|cirrostratus` discriminator key.
  The engine previously returned generic guidance for that pair; the key now
  follows the same sorted convention as every lookup.

## Broken/Modified Tests

- Extended `content.test.mjs` to validate the five evidence classes and every
  cloud identifier referenced by scoring weights.
- Extended `foundation.test.mjs` to enforce the observer method, remove the
  binary key, verify the WMO source, and guard install metadata paths.
- Added `field-guide.test.mjs` for canonical convection, scale discrimination,
  close-pair guidance, deterministic ties, and journal drafts.
- Extended content and foundation tests to require all-ten-genus comparison
  coverage, dedicated pair discriminators, seven substantive dimensions, eight
  hard cases, and the direct `atlas/compare` route.

## Future Work

Automatic photograph recognition remains backlog task 0002.

# CLOUD RECOGNITION

Polish, source-backed education for learning to identify clouds and understand
the weather from first observation through advanced aviation interpretation.

The first release will include:

- adaptive knowledge placement instead of forcing everyone through lesson one;
- a WMO-based cloud atlas and visual decision key;
- guided lessons, quizzes, disputed cases, and an observation journal;
- aviation weather: METAR/TAF, ceilings, icing, turbulence, convection, and
  thunderstorms;
- an independent laboratory for AGL, MSL, pressure levels, geopotential
  height, and the vertical layers used in Windy;
- visible sources and confidence notes throughout the learning experience;
- a mobile-first installable web app with offline learning support.

Version 1 deliberately does not classify photos automatically and includes no
voice or audio system.

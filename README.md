# CLOUD RECOGNITION

Polish, source-backed education for learning to identify clouds and understand
the weather from first observation through advanced aviation interpretation.

The application includes:

- adaptive knowledge placement instead of forcing everyone through lesson one;
- a WMO-based encyclopedia with 10 genera, 49 formal taxonomy terms, and
  evidence-aware search across names, codes, morphology, and diagnostic clues;
- an evidence-based field observer with three transparent hypotheses;
- a differential comparison laboratory for two or three cloud genera;
- nine full lessons with honest time plans, sourced chapters, worked examples,
  chapter-by-chapter mobile focus, active recall, module-specific practice,
  checks, and an adaptive recognition review map;
- aviation weather: complete METAR anatomy, active METAR/TAF decoding,
  three-station briefings, transparent local spaced review, ceilings, icing,
  turbulence, convection, and thunderstorms;
- an independent laboratory for AGL, MSL, pressure levels, geopotential
  height, and the vertical layers used in Windy;
- visible sources and confidence notes throughout the learning experience;
- a mobile-first installable web app with offline learning support.

The current version deliberately does not classify photos automatically and
includes no voice or audio system.
